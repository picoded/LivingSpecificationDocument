While the actual filtering option list is customizable. The general concept is to help sort the content and output only the needed parts.

Generally they are some variant of the following

+ Project phases
+ Functional vs Technical
+ Implementation

Take the following for example

| Viewer             | Purpose                | Chosen filters         |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Salesperson Salesy | Convincing customers   | **Current phase**, **Functional**, **Completed** and perhaps even **Buggy** so she knows what to avoid in the demo  |
| Salesperson Salesy | Updating investors     | **All phases**, **Functional**, **Completed**, **To do next**, with some of her own slides on speculative future growth |
| Developer Desi     | Getting code done      | **Current phases**, **Technical**, **Completed**, **Buggy**, **To do next**. She does not care about **Functional** having heard Salesy a 100 times |
| Intern Newly       | Understanding as much as possible | **Everything** |

Note that however, unless done up properly by the document writer in the section configuration, and the document specific styling. These filters have little use, and by default just shows everything. Ultimately, this whole tool provides a framework to help build the interactive document. Leaving the actual display logic to the implementer.
