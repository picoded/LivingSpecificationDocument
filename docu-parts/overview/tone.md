BTW if you have not noticed it yet, generally the tone of this document is very informal. This is completely intentional, because one of the problems you will probably face is actually getting people to read this document. Let alone follow it. 

However sadly, I have to warn as well, you should be careful using this tone more internally, then externally. And may need to make a judgement call for some of your clients.

You know, especially those very highly paid, importantly looking people in suits. Some of them can hardly take a joke in a specification. Party poppers.
