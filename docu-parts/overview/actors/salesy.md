Salesy is a busy busy woman. On a typical day, she is constantly running around the city ~~drinking alcohol with customers~~ convincing customers. On why the company product is the best product in the world, and why they should _buy it now(TM)_.

However customers can be a rather tricky animal, everyone of them have very different priorities and wants. Understanding and matching their wants is a very tricky process. 

For example, one of Salesy customer is much more interested in racing around his flashy new sports car, then making sure his business is profiting enough to pay for that new sports car. To convince him, Salesy told him a story on how he *could* become a better racer (he never will, he is terrible), with all the free time he will gain from using the specification building tool her company sells (the free time gained is true, but he probably will use it bragging about the car rather then practicing)

With over a hundred customers ~~or so she wishes~~ she needs to understand her company products well, and figure out what features matches what they want (or atleast looks like it does so). Salesy does not care about the technical details, she only sees the functional specification. After all, it does not matter what is MeSQL (is it edible?), if her customer needs to use their products with it, all she needs to do is search up the specification for it.

If not, she would be ~~hounding~~ calling Manci up to check if it is supported. Even at the most unearthly hours.

Sadly for Manci, while it does stop Salesy from disturbing her for things inside the specifications. It does not stop Salesy from asking her to add in things that was intentionally not in the specifications 

(Sorry Salesy & Desi, cat icons for the user interface is the least of Manci worries)
