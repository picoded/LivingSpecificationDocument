A specification building tool, for building a highly functional (& printable) Functional / Technical specification.

And what better way to showcase this tool. By writing itself out as a specification!

This project draws directly from personal experience, with much inspiration from [Joel on Software : Painless functional specification](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html)

By default, this document should only cover what the user sees when they interact with it (AKA: Functional specification).

However this can be changed around to cover the technical specification, or both. Just by toggling the document type on the left. 

Which is the beauty of this whole specification building tool.
