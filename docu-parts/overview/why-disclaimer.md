Have you read the link? Here it is again [Joel on Software : Painless functional specification (Part 2)](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000035.html)

If not... let me quote it for you... lazy bugger...

> Pure self defense. If you put a paragraph saying something like "This spec is not complete", people won't come into your office to bite your head off. As time goes on, when the spec starts to be complete, you can change it to say "this spec is complete, to the best of my knowledge, but if I forgot something, please tell me."

And if you seriously intend to write specifications, you really should read the link provided.

But on a more practical note, this should always be there. Because your specification should be "alive" and changing. It should even be in your source control repository of the project. So that everyone working on the project will always be up to date on it.

If not, its just going to end up on the shelf, collecting dust. And end up being a complete waste of time. Which is the number one reason why everyone hates specifications.
