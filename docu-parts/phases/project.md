| **Basic POC<br/>(Proof Of Concept)** | Covers the minimum required to create this document, with a writer who knows how to setup, and configure the respective configuration file, and layout the various markdown files. |
| **Advanced viewer** | Probably what I wished I could have done in the Basic POC. Where it has all the functionality i would want for readers of the specs |
| **Editor** | Bringing this helper tool to the next level. By packaging this with a Node.js server program. Anyone with access to the package can make changes within its own interface, add sections, etc =) |
| **Wishes & Dreams** | Various other features, that multiple people wish exists in the system. But you probably do not need. Think of this as the icing on the cake. Just that most of the time, these icing takes a lot more effort then I wish it needed, haha. |

And frankly speaking, unless the project is really small. Of which i question why are you writing a specification for it, instead of just prototyping it and adding comments to the source code. You should ALWAYS split it up to phases, not just for your current sanity, but your future one as well when the specification gets changed.
